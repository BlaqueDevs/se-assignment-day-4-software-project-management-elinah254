Regular Budget Reviews – Conduct frequent financial assessments to adjust allocations as needed.


## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Agile and Waterfall are two widely used software development methodologies, each with distinct approaches to project management. Waterfall follows a linear, sequential process, while Agile is iterative and flexible.
Waterfall Methodology
Waterfall follows a structured approach where each phase (requirements, design, implementation, testing, and deployment) is completed before moving to the next.
Advantages:
Clearly defined project scope and requirements from the start
Easier to manage for projects with fixed budgets and timelines
Well-documented process, making it suitable for regulated industries
Disadvantages:
Inflexible to changes once a phase is completed
Late-stage testing increases the risk of finding major issues late in development
Not ideal for projects where requirements may evolve over time
Agile Methodology
Agile is an iterative approach where development happens in small, incremental cycles called sprints. Continuous feedback and collaboration help refine the product throughout the process.
Advantages:
Highly adaptable to changing requirements
Frequent testing and iterations improve product quality
Encourages collaboration between developers, stakeholders, and users
Disadvantages:
Requires active involvement from stakeholders, which may not always be feasible
Can be difficult to estimate time and cost accurately due to ongoing changes
Less emphasis on documentation, which may lead to challenges in long-term maintenance


## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Agile works well for projects that require flexibility, regular updates, and continuous user feedback. It is ideal for fast-paced environments where requirements may evolve.
Examples:
Mobile App Development: Features and designs are updated based on user feedback and market trends.
Online Retail Platforms: Websites that need frequent updates, such as new product listings, promotions, and user experience improvements.
Artificial Intelligence Projects: Machine learning models that require regular testing, data adjustments, and refinements.
Video Game Development: Games that release in beta versions and are refined over time based on player feedback.

Waterfall on the other hand is best for projects with clearly defined requirements, strict timelines, and minimal expected changes. It is often used in industries where detailed documentation and compliance are critical.
Examples:
Government IT Systems: Projects that require thorough documentation and approval before implementation.
Banking Software: Applications that must comply with strict security and financial regulations.
Infrastructure Projects: Large-scale construction projects like bridges or highways, where planning must be finalized before execution.
Medical Software Development: Hospital management systems that need to meet strict regulatory standards before deployment.
We should therefore conclude that Agile is ideal for projects that need frequent adjustments, while Waterfall is better suited for structured projects with a well-defined scope. The choice depends on the project’s complexity, timeline, and flexibility requirements.
